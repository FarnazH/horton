'''Tools for avoiding recomputation of earlier results

   In principle, the ``JustOnceClass`` and the ``Cache`` can be used
   independently, but in some cases it makes a lot of sense to combine them.
   See for example. the density partitioning code in ``horton.dpart``.

class JustOnceClass(object):
    '''Base class for classes with methods that should never be executed twice.

       In typically applications, these methods get called many times, but
       only during the first call, an actual computation is carried out. This
       way, the caller can safely call a method, just to make sure that a
       required result is computed.

       All methods in the subclasses that should have this feature, must be
       given the ``just_once`` decoratore, e.g. ::

           class Example(JustOnceClass):
               @just_once
               def do_something():
                   self.foo = self.bar

       When all results are outdate, one can call the ``invalidate`` method
       to forget which methods were called already.
