Built-in atomic integration grids
#################################

The table below lists the number of grid points in each built-in atomic
integration grid in Horton. For the heavier elements (after Kr), the grids are
calibrated based on reference computations with pseudo potentials. In the
script horton-wpart, these grids are referred to as coarse, medium, fine,
veryfine, ultrafine and insane, respectively. The last digit in the grid name
refers to the number of significant digits obtained with these grids on diatomic
benchmarks.
