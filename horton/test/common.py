            The function whose derivatives must be to be tested

       fun_deriv
            The implementation of the analytical derivatives

       x
            The argument for the reference point.

       dxs
            A list with small relative changes to x

       A threshold is set to the median of the D1 set. For each case where |D1|
       is larger than the threshold, |D1 - D2|, should be smaller than the
       threshold.
